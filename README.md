## Installing pre-requisites:

### *If installing Hyperledger Composer using Linux, be aware of the following advice:
- Login as a normal user, rather than root.
- Do not su to root.
- When installing prerequisites, use curl, then unzip using sudo.
- Run prereqs-ubuntu.sh as a normal user. It may prompt for root password as some of it's actions are required to be run as root.
- Do not use npm with sudo or su to root to use it.
- Avoid installing node globally as root.

### I. To install pre-requisites you should use following commands:

curl -O https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/v0.19/prereqs-ubuntu.sh

chmod u+x prereqs-ubuntu.sh

./prereqs-ubuntu.sh
